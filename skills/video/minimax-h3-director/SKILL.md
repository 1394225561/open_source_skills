description: Orchestrate H3-only cinematic preproduction and produce official-structure MiniMax H3 prompts for T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, L2VA, and Ref2VA. Use for H3 text, first-frame, last-frame, first-and-last-frame, multimodal-reference, video-editing, video-continuation, dialogue/audio, prompt-repair, complete production-package, or Seedance-to-H3 requests. Optionally route static asset work, acting/voice design, and cinematic direction through installed $lira-image-prompts, $acting-for-ai-video, and $cinedance-seedance-director, then translate only their relevant outputs into H3. Do not use for final Seedance output or as a wrapper around $cinema-studio-production.

# MiniMax H3 Director

Act as the independent H3 production orchestrator and final H3 assembler. Target H3 only. Do not invoke `$cinema-studio-production`, emit a Seedance final prompt, or combine H3 and Seedance syntax.

## Apply source authority

Resolve conflicts in this order:

1. The user's current request, supplied assets, and locked facts
2. Official H3 model constraints and prompt contracts in this skill's references
3. This orchestration and handoff policy
4. Scene-adapted output from optional specialists
5. Transferable cinematic heuristics

Treat current interface limits as execution constraints, not replacements for official model limits. Never invent a capability, parameter, asset, handle, dialogue line, or reference relationship.

Use and redistribute the bundled official MiniMax materials only within the territory and conditions stated in `LICENSE`. Keep `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and the unmodified official prompt-writing package together with this skill when distributing it.

## Run the workflow

1. Confirm that the requested final model is H3. For a Seedance final output, stop and direct the user to `$cinema-studio-production`.
2. Classify every requested deliverable. Distinguish asset prompts, acting or voice artifacts, cinematic direction, H3 settings, and the final H3 prompt.
3. Inventory supplied media by actual role. Separate real accessible assets from descriptions, planned assets, and prompts for assets.
4. Select the H3 prompt mode from the table below. Distinguish the human-facing prompt mode from the runtime task value.
5. Select the smallest optional-specialist chain that produces the requested deliverables or repairs genuinely underspecified layers.
6. Read the required references completely. Read optional specialist instructions only when that specialist is selected.
7. Preserve authoritative inputs through each handoff. Strip planning labels, expert commentary, unsupported metadata, and Seedance-only syntax before H3 assembly.
8. Assemble the final prompt in the exact official structure for the selected mode. Run the applicable silent QA.
9. Deliver only the requested artifacts. Keep settings outside the Context-IR prompt.

## Retrieve an optional scene case

Use `$cinematic-scene-case-library` only when the scene request is abstract,
lacks shootable scene structure, asks to repair a Prompt, or explicitly asks
for a case reference. Skip retrieval when the supplied scene is already
concrete, shootable, and complete enough for H3 assembly. Retrieve directly;
never invoke or route this H3 workflow through `$cinema-studio-production`.

When retrieval is triggered, resolve the case-library skill from the current
available-skills catalog and follow its progressive-loading instructions.
Load the index, guidance-package schema, and normally one relevant case. Ask it
for a filtered guidance package; never request or forward a complete case file
or source Prompt.

The source-authority order in this skill remains controlling. Case guidance is
only a transferable cinematic heuristic below user-locked facts, official H3
rules, this orchestrator, and selected expert output. Omit conflicting case
suggestions. Pass only `acting_handoff` performance facts to ACTING when that
specialist is selected. Use `directing_handoff` only as directing input for the
smallest necessary repair path. Keep H3 adapter notes inside this director for
final H3 translation; discard Seedance adapter notes and Seedance output
schema.

Never convert case provenance into active H3 references. Do not forward
historical `@tag` values, source asset IDs, media URLs, historical duration or
generation metadata, source model syntax, provenance, or Prompt score. Only
real supplied assets may receive H3 labels. `minimax-h3-director` still owns
Context-IR, mode selection, timing, official H3 syntax, final assembly, and QA.

## Select the H3 mode

| Actual input role | Prompt mode | Runtime task |
|---|---|---|
| No media reference | T2VA | `t2va` |
| One real image fixed as the first frame at 0.00 seconds | I2VA | `fl2va` |
| One real image fixed as the final frame | L2VA | `fl2va` |
| Two real images fixed as first and last frames | FL2VA | `fl2va` |
| Any image, video, or audio used as identity, scene, style, action, camera, storyboard, voice, sound, edit, continuation, or mixed reference | Ref2VA | `ref2va` |

Classify by role, not file count. A character image used only for identity is Ref2VA, not I2VA. A source video being edited or continued is Ref2VA. A multimodal request containing a concrete frame anchor plus other reference roles is Ref2VA with `keyframe completion` among its task relationships.

If the user supplies an existing Seedance or other video prompt without real reference media, classify the intended H3 generation from the described inputs; the source prompt itself is not a media reference.

## Load references progressively

Always read [h3-model-capabilities.md](references/h3-model-capabilities.md) and [h3-routing-and-handoffs.md](references/h3-routing-and-handoffs.md).

- Read [the official H3 prompt-writing skill](references/official-skills/h3-prompt-writing/SKILL.md) before assembling any H3 prompt.
- For T2VA, I2VA, FL2VA, or L2VA, completely read [the official base guide](references/official-skills/h3-prompt-writing/references/base-en.txt).
- For Ref2VA, video editing, video continuation, or mixed references, completely read [the official Ref2VA guide](references/official-skills/h3-prompt-writing/references/ref-en.txt) and [the official base guide](references/official-skills/h3-prompt-writing/references/base-en.txt), because the Ref2VA guide delegates shared shot, speaker, dialogue, camera, and sound rules to the base guide.
- For an existing Seedance prompt or Seedance-derived specialist output, read [seedance-to-h3-adaptation.md](references/seedance-to-h3-adaptation.md).
- For a complete production package, complex multi-shot sequence, asset-heavy workflow, or prompt repair, read [h3-production-patterns.md](references/h3-production-patterns.md).
- When the user requests an official-source audit, exact capability evidence, API/local request construction, or the 768p-to-2K workflow, first read [official-source-provenance.md](references/official-source-provenance.md), then read the applicable sections of the unmodified [official Chinese README](references/official-repository/README.zh-CN.md) or [official English README](references/official-repository/README.md), and only the matching script under `references/official-repository/scripts/readme/`. Do not load repository documentation for an ordinary prompt-writing request.

When the request explicitly matches one official MiniMax style workflow, read that workflow's `SKILL.md` and only its directly required references under `references/official-skills/`:

| Explicit workflow | Optional official reference |
|---|---|
| End-to-end stylized 3D narrative short | [3d-animation-short-generator](references/official-skills/3d-animation-short-generator/SKILL.md) |
| Brand or product promotional short | [brand-promo-video-generator](references/official-skills/brand-promo-video-generator/SKILL.md) |
| Two-player co-op game menu or intro | [co-op-game-intro-generator](references/official-skills/co-op-game-intro-generator/SKILL.md) |
| Glowing hand-drawn animation interacting with live action | [handdrawn-live-video-generator](references/official-skills/handdrawn-live-video-generator/SKILL.md) |
| Minimalist product advertisement | [minimalist-product-ad-generator](references/official-skills/minimalist-product-ad-generator/SKILL.md) |
| Music video with lyric or subtitle typography | [music-video-subtitle-generator](references/official-skills/music-video-subtitle-generator/SKILL.md) |
| Paper-collage explainer | [paper-collage-explainer-generator](references/official-skills/paper-collage-explainer-generator/SKILL.md) |
| Papercraft stop-motion explainer | [papercraft-stop-motion-explainer](references/official-skills/papercraft-stop-motion-explainer/SKILL.md) |

Treat these eight skills as read-only creative and production references. They explicitly require MiniMax Hub and are not portable runtime dependencies. Do not execute or reproduce canvas operations, choice cards, `hub_*` calls, Seedance fallback, or fixed platform-delivery steps. Their style and workflow guidance may inform requested upstream artifacts, but it cannot override official H3 Context-IR, real-asset discipline, or H3-only final ownership. Do not load them for an ordinary H3 prompt.

## Orchestrate optional specialists

Resolve each selected specialist from the current available-skills catalog. Read its `SKILL.md` completely, then follow its own reference-routing instructions. Do not assume that a same-named folder makes a skill available to the current agent.

- Select `$lira-image-prompts` only when static asset prompts or image edits are requested as deliverables. Do not select it merely because a video mentions characters, places, props, or keyframes.
- Select `$acting-for-ai-video` for an acting master profile, fixed voice, requested scene-performance design, or abstract performance that must become filmable. Pass only the current scene adaptation downstream.
- Select `$cinedance-seedance-director` as an optional directing engine when spatial blocking, gaze, optics, camera, physics, lighting, timing, dialogue/audio, or continuity requires substantial design or repair. Discard its Seedance output schema and translate only relevant directing content through H3 rules.

If a selected specialist is unavailable, name the missing dependency. Continue without it only when the supplied material is sufficient for valid H3 assembly; otherwise complete independent deliverables and state the exact blocked artifact. Never reconstruct a missing specialist from memory.

Do not rerun all specialists for a complete existing prompt. Use the smallest chain needed to preserve or repair it.

## Enforce asset truth

Only real, supplied, accessible assets may receive active H3 reference labels. Preserve their actual order or identifiers consistently. Never convert a generated image prompt into `<Picture N>`, an acting voice description into `<Audio N>`, or an intended clip into `<Video N>`.

Mark non-existent dependencies as `planned` or `prompt prepared`. If the user requests both upstream asset prompts and a downstream reference-bound H3 prompt, deliver the upstream artifacts and state that final reference binding remains blocked until the assets exist, unless the user explicitly requested a reusable placeholder template.

## Separate prompt and settings

The H3 Context-IR prompt contains only the selected official prompt structure. Keep runtime configuration in a separate `H3 SETTINGS` artifact when requested or operationally useful:

```text
prompt_mode: T2VA | I2VA | FL2VA | L2VA | Ref2VA
runtime_task: t2va | fl2va | ref2va
duration_seconds: confirmed value
aspect_ratio: confirmed value
short_edge: confirmed value
seed: confirmed value
conditions: supplied assets and roles
```

Omit unknown settings rather than inventing them. Do not treat a sample script's value as a universal default. Segment an intended output longer than 15 seconds into multiple H3 generations with explicit continuity handoffs; never claim it is one valid generation.

## Deliver

- For a prompt-only request, return only `H3 PROMPT` and the official-structure prompt.
- When settings are requested or needed for direct execution, return `H3 SETTINGS` followed by `H3 PROMPT`.
- For multiple requested artifacts, return only applicable sections in dependency order: `ASSET PROMPTS`, `ACTING PROFILE`, `VOICE`, `SCENE PERFORMANCE`, `H3 SETTINGS`, `H3 PROMPT`.
- Write user-facing notes in the user's language. Write the H3 prompt structure and descriptive body in English. Preserve dialogue, lyrics, and visible scene text in their original language.
- Honor prompt-only output unless the user requests analysis, alternatives, QA, or workflow notes.

## Final orchestration check

Verify silently:

- The final artifact targets H3 only and uses exactly one official prompt syntax family.
- The prompt mode and runtime task agree with the actual roles of all supplied inputs.
- Every active reference label maps to a real asset and stays semantically stable.
- Optional specialists were selected only when needed, and their output did not override official H3 syntax.
- User facts, dialogue, visible text, duration, reference roles, and locked creative decisions remain intact.
- Shot timing fits the confirmed duration; outputs longer than 15 seconds are segmented.
- Settings remain outside the prompt, unknown parameters are omitted, and no UI-specific claim is presented as a model fact.
- The selected mode's reference-specific QA passes.
